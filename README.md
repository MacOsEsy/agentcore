**The open standard for High-Density AI coding instructions. Make your AI smarter, faster, and more consistent.**

> **Fork notice**: AgentCore is a fork of the original [`agent-skills-standard`](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard), maintained by **Van Toan** at [`MacOsEsy/agent-skills-standard`](https://github.com/MacOsEsy/agent-skills-standard).

AgentCore is a modular framework to distribute, sync, and version-control engineering standards across all major AI agents (**Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Gemini, Antigravity, and custom LLM workflows**), built on top of the original Agent Skills Standard.

---

## 💡 What is this?

Think of AgentCore as a **universal instruction manual** for your AI assistant.

Usually, when you use AI for work, you have to constantly remind it of your "house rules" (e.g., _"Make sure to handle errors this way"_ or _"Use this specific layout"_). This project allows teams to package those rules into **"Skills"** that you can plug into any AI tool instantly.

### Why does this matter?

- **For Managers**: Ensure your entire team writes high-quality code that follows your company's standards, regardless of which AI tool they use.
- **For Non-IT Users**: You don't need to know _how_ the rules are written; you just run one command to "upgrade" your AI with professional-grade engineering knowledge.
- **For Teams**: No more "Hey, why did the AI write it this way?"—everyone's AI uses the same playbook.

---

## ⚡ The Problem: "The Context Wall"

Modern AI coding agents are powerful, but they struggle when managing project-wide rules:

1. **Information Overload**: Providing too many instructions at once confuses the AI and makes it forgetful.
2. **Version Chaos**: Every team member has a different version of "best practices" floating around their local computer.
3. **Wasted Space**: Long, wordy instructions "eat up" the AI's limited memory (the Context Window), making it more expensive and less effective.

---

## 🛠 The Solution: Digital DNA for AI

AgentCore treats instructions as **versioned dependencies**, much like software libraries.

- **🎯 Smart Loading**: We use a "Search-on-Demand" pattern. The AI only looks at detailed examples when it specifically needs them, saving its memory for your actual code.
- **🚀 High-Density Language**: We use a specialized "Compressed Syntax" that is **40% more efficient** than normal English. This means the AI understands more while using fewer resources.
- **🔁 One-Click Sync**: A single command ensures your AI tool stays up-to-date with your team's latest standards.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Trust

We understand that "injecting" instructions into your AI can sound risky. Here is how we keep you safe:

- **No Code Execution**: Skills are pure Markdown/JSON files. They contain _text instructions_ for the AI, not executable code. They cannot run commands on your machine.
- **Open Source**: The entire registry is open source. You can audit every skill file on GitHub before using it.
- **Sandboxed**: The AgentCore CLI (`agentcore`) runs in user space to download text files. The "skills" themselves run inside the AI's isolated context window, not as OS processes.
- **Privacy**: We do not collect any code or project data. Feedback is only sent if you manually trigger the `feedback` command or strongly opt-in.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🛡️ Multi-Agent Support**: Out-of-the-box mapping for Cursor, Claude Dev, GitHub Copilot, and more.
- **📦 Modular Registry**: Don't load everything. Only enable the skills your project actually uses.
- **⚡ Proactive Activation (Universal)**: Generates a compressed index in `AGENTS.md` for 100% activation reliability across Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and more.
- **🔄 Dynamic Re-detection**: Automatically re-enables skills if matching dependencies are added.
- **🔒 Secure Overrides**: Lock specific files so they never get overwritten.
- **📊 Semantic Tagging**: Skills tagged with triggers for exact application.
- **🤖 Agent Workflows**: Sync executable workflows (.md files) that agents can follow to perform complex tasks.

---

## 🛠️ CLI Commands

- `init`: Initialize a fresh `.skillsrc` config.
- `sync`: Sync skills from remote registry and automatically update the `AGENTS.md` index.
- `validate`: Validate skill format and token standards.
- `feedback`: Report skill violations or improvements.
- `upgrade`: Upgrade the CLI to the latest version.

---

## ✨ Token Economy & Optimization

To ensure AI efficiency, this project follows a strict **Token Economy**. Every skill is audited for its footprint in the AI's context window.

### 📏 Our Standards

- **High-Density**: Core rules in `SKILL.md` are kept under **70 lines**.
- **Efficiency**: Target **< 500 tokens** per primary skill file.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Heavy examples, checklists, and implementation guides are moved to the `references/` directory and are only loaded by the agent when specific context matches.

### 🛠️ Token Calculation

We provide a built-in tool in the CLI to estimate and track the token footprint:

```bash
pnpm calculate-tokens
```

This command:

1. Scans all `SKILL.md` files in the registry.
2. Calculates character-based token estimates.
3. Updates `skills/metadata.json` with category metrics (total tokens, avg/skill, and identifying the largest skills).

By maintaining a "Lean Registry," we ensure that your AI assistant remains fast and focused, preserving the majority of its context window for your actual project code.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Feedback

### Feedback Reporter Skill

By default, the CLI syncs a `common/feedback-reporter` skill that enables you to report when AI makes mistakes or when skill guidance needs improvement. **This helps us improve skills for everyone.**

**What Gets Shared (Only if You Report):**

- Skill category and name
- Issue description (written by you or generated by AI)
- **Skill Instruction**: Exact quote from the skill that was violated
- **Actual Action**: What the AI did instead
- **Decision Reason**: Why the AI chose that approach
- Optional context (framework version, scenario)
- Optional AI Model name
- **NO code, NO project details, NO personal information**

**How to Opt-Out:**
Add to `.skillsrc`:

```yaml
skills:
  common:
    exclude: ['feedback-reporter']
```

#### Manual Feedback

If you notice a skill needs improvement, you can manually send feedback using (no installation required):

```bash
npx agentcore feedback
```

**How it works:**

- **Cross-Platform**: Works instantly on **Windows, MacOS, and Linux** via `npx`.
- The CLI attempts to submit your feedback automatically via our **High-Density Feedback Backend** (hosted on Render.com).
- **No token needed**: We handle the GitHub integration securely on the server.

Or via structured comments in your code:

```typescript
// @agent-skills-feedback
// Skill: react/hooks
// Issue: AI suggested unsafe pattern
// Suggestion: Add guidance for this case
```

**Privacy First**: We never collect usage telemetry or analytics. Feedback is only shared if you explicitly trigger it.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Get running in 60s)

Consume engineering standards in your project instantly.

### 1. Run the CLI

```bash
npx agentcore@latest init
```

_The interactive wizard will detect your stack and setup your `.skillsrc`._

### 2. Sync Standards

```bash
npx agentcore@latest sync
```

### 3. Automatic Activation

Whenever you run `sync`, the CLI automatically updates `AGENTS.md` in your project root with a compressed index of your enabled skills.

This `AGENTS.md` file serves as a **universal entry point** that helps all AI agents proactively understand when to trigger specific skills based on your project context.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`.skillsrc`)

The `.skillsrc` file allows you to customize how skills are synced to your project.

```yaml
registry: https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard
agents: [cursor, copilot, kiro]
skills:
  flutter:
    ref: flutter-v1.1.0
    # 🚫 Exclude specific sub-skills from being synced
    exclude: ['getx-navigation']
    # ➕ Include specific skills (supports cross-category 'category/skill' or 'category/*' syntax)
    include:
      - 'bloc-state-management'
      - 'react/hooks'
      - 'common/*'
    # 🔒 Protect local modifications from being overwritten
    custom_overrides: ['bloc-state-management']
  # 🤖 Optional: Sync workflows to .agent/workflows/
  workflows: true
```

### Key Options

- **`exclude`**: A list of skill IDs to skip during synchronization.
- **`include`**: A list of skill IDs to fetch. Supports:
  - **Relative Path**: `bloc-state-management` (from current category)
  - **Absolute Path**: `react/hooks` (pull specific skill from another category)
  - **Glob Path**: `common/*` (pull ALL skills from another category)
- **`custom_overrides`**: A list of skill IDs that the CLI should **never** overwrite.
- **`ref`**: Specify a specific version or tag for the skills.

### Project-Specific Skills

For project-specific rules that differ from or extend the standard registry skills, create local skills in your agent's skills directory (e.g., `.github/skills/project/` for Copilot). These local skills will not be overwritten during sync operations.

Example:

Create `.github/skills/project/your-project-standards/SKILL.md` with your custom rules.

This approach ensures your project-specific standards are preserved while benefiting from upstream updates.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Invalid .skillsrc

If the CLI complains about configuration format:

- Ensure `registry` is a valid URL.
- Ensure `skills` is a map of categories to config objects.
- Run `npx agentcore@latest init` to generate a fresh valid config.

> [!TIP]
> **Quality Engineering (Opt-in)**: Advanced skills like `business-analysis` or `zephyr-test-generation` are in the **quality-engineering** category and are NOT synced by default to keep context lean. To use them, manually add the category to your `.skillsrc`:
>
> ```yaml
> skills:
>   quality-engineering: { ref: quality-engineering-v1.0.0 }
> ```
>
> [!TIP]
> **Enterprise Ready**: You can host your own **Private Skills Registry** on GitHub and point the CLI to it via the `registry` field in your `.skillsrc`.

## 📂 Standard Specification

The standard follows a strict directory structure designed for **Token Economy**.

```text
skills/
└── flutter/                    # Category
    └── bloc-state-management/      # Skill
        ├── SKILL.md                # Core Rules (High Density)
        └── references/             # Heavy Examples (Loaded only on demand)
```

The CLI will sync this exact structure effectively to your agent configuration:

```text
.cursor/skills/
└── flutter/
    └── bloc-state-management/
```

## 🏗 Contributing & Development

Interested in adding standards for **NestJS, Golang, or React**? We follow a strict semantic versioning for every skill category.

1. **Propose a Skill**: Open an issue with your draft [High-Density Content](skills/README.md).
2. **Develop Locally**: Fork and add your category to `skills/`.
3. **Submit PR**: Our CI/CD will validate the metadata integrity before merging.

### Local Development Testing

To test your changes locally before publishing to NPM:

```bash
# In your test project directory, point npx to your local CLI folder
npx /path/to/agent-skills-standard/cli sync
```

This is the recommended way to verify that skill injections and discovery bridges (like `.cursorrules`) work correctly in a real project environment.
